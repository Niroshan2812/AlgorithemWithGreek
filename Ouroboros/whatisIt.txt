The Ouroboros: A Symbol of Cyclicity

The Ouroboros is an ancient symbol depicting a serpent or dragon eating its own tail. 
It forms a circle, representing eternity or a neverending cycle. The word itself comes 
from Ancient Greek, where "ouro" means "tail" and "boros" means "devouring." So, 
literally, it translates to "tail-devourer."

Interpretations of the Ouroboros

The Ouroboros has been interpreted in various ways throughout history. 

Here are some of the most common meanings:

Eternal Cyclic Renewal: Perhaps the most common interpretation, the Ouroboros represents 
the cyclical nature of life, death, and rebirth. The snake shedding its skin can symbolize
the continual process of transformation and renewal.

Unity of All Things: The Ouroboros can represent the interconnectedness and unity of all 
things, both material and spiritual. Nothing is truly destroyed, but everything transforms 
and becomes something new.

Fertility Symbol: In some cultures, the Ouroboros is seen as a fertility symbol. 
The tail can be seen as a phallic symbol, and the mouth as a womb-like symbol, 
representing the cyclical nature of life and procreation.

The Ouroboros in History

The Ouroboros is one of the oldest symbols known, appearing in Egyptian iconography 
as early as the 14th century BCE. It was later adopted by the Greeks and became a 
significant symbol in Gnosticism, Hermeticism, and particularly Alchemy.
